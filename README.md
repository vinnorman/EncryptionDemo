# Demonstration of Encryption on Android
#### By Vin Norman

This project is in response to a technical test from a potential employer.

## The Brief

1. Application should have a main screen with ability to let user enter plain text
2. Main screen should have a way to display a user two results:  “Encrypted String” and “Decrypted String”
3. Main screen should have two buttons “Encrypt” and “Decrypt”.
4. When user enters plain text and clicks “Encrypt” a new KeyPair should be created.
5. With a KeyPair the passed plain text should be encrypted and shown back to the user in a readable format
6. User should have an ability to press “Decrypt” button to decrypt the encrypted String, and show the original plain text back to the User using the same KeyPair.

## My response

I did a little background research on encryption to further my understanding. Primarily this involved a foundational understanding of the two widespread types of encryption used today, symmetric and asymmetric encryption, as well as some background in a popular example of each (AES for symmetric, RSA for asymmetric). 

I selected the RSA algorithm as there appeared to be good standard built-in Android/Java support for this, and also as it was necessary to have an encryption algorithm that was asymmetric - that is, with public and private key pairs - to fulfil the brief.
